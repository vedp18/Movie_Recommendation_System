## 2. Project Overview

This project aims to create a basic movie recommendation engine.  It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on the ratings of similar users.  The system is designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different datasets and recommendation algorithms.

**Key Features:**

*   Movie recommendation based on collaborative filtering.
*   Utilizes user rating data to generate personalized recommendations.
*   Simple and intuitive user interface (if applicable, detail the UI).
*   Potential for expansion to include content-based filtering or hybrid approaches.


**Problem Solved:** Helps users discover new movies they might enjoy based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

**Use Cases:**  This system can be used by individuals to find new movies to watch, or by streaming services to personalize user experiences.

## 5. Installation Guide

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vedp18/Movie_Recommendation_System.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd Movie_Recommendation_System`
3.  Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## 7. Usage Examples

I am not sure.  The provided repository does not contain readily usable code examples or a clear indication of how to run the recommendation system.  The `requirements.txt` suggests that the system likely uses scikit-learn for the recommendation algorithm, but the implementation details are missing from the provided information.  To provide usage examples, the code itself needs to be examined.


## 8. Project Architecture

I am not sure.  The provided information does not describe the project's architecture.  To describe the architecture, a deeper analysis of the codebase is required.
